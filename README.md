# Ambianic Client UI

Ambianic Client UI is an Offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) to manage Ambianic Edge deployments. 

The app is explicitly designed with user privacy and data ownership in mind:

* Stores data exclusively on user's own client device (desktop or mobile). 
* Does not store ANY user information in the cloud. 
* User may explicitly chose to store a backup of their data on a server of their choice. 
* User data remains 100% owned and controlled by the user at all times. 
* No fine print. No obscure opt-in / opt-out pop-ups of any kind.
